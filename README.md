# Portfolio-Website

## Description

A portfolio website is required to be built showcasing the HTML and CSS I have learnt so far, especially FlexBox and Grid. 

The portfolio application is to be built from scratch but must resemble the screenshot gif below. There are several criteria that must be met for this portfolio application and are as follows:

* My name (Robert Saunders) must be displayed along with a recent profile picture as well as links to sections about me, my work and how to contact me
* When a navigation link is clicked, the UI must scroll to the corresponding section
* The section that displays my work must contained titled images of my applications
* The first application's image should be larger in size than the others
* When images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application
* The website must be responsive to the viewport of any size screen
